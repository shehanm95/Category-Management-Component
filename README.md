# Category and Subcategory Management Component

This project provides a Bootstrap-based UI component for managing categories and their respective sub-categories. Each category can contain multiple sub-categories, and the UI includes interactive features for adding, selecting, and deleting categories and sub-categories. Deleted items are moved to an "Others" section as a default fallback.

## Features

- **Add Categories**: Enter a category name and add it to the list.
- **Select and Add Subcategories**: Select a category to enable adding related sub-categories.
- **Move Deleted Subcategories**: If a category is deleted, its sub-categories are moved to the default "Others" section.
- **Quick Actions**: Each category and sub-category tag has a cross (`Ã—`) button for deletion.
- **Keyboard Support**: Press "Enter" to quickly submit category or sub-category input.


## Dependencies

This component relies on Bootstrap 5 for styling:
- Bootstrap CSS and JS from CDN
